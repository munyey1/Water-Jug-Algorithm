# Water Jug Algorithm
 
Developed a depth-first search algorithm to solve the water-jug problem. The algorithm takes the capacities of three jugs and generates a set of all possible states that can be reached from the start state (0, 0, 0). The solution involved defining data structures to represent states, keeping track of visited states, and recursively generating possible next states. This project demonstrates my problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
